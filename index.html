      <h1>Linking between pages</h1>
      <p>Adding links is very easy to do! We use <a href="anchors.html">anchors</a> to link from one page to another page. We can also link another page<p> called <a href="attributes.html">attributes.</a></p> 
      <p>This is a link to the earth page: <a href="/earthandmars/earth.html">LINK</a></p>
